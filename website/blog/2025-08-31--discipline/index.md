This piece is a response to a few folks. Primarily, it's a direct
response to my dear friend
[Florence](https://florenceyho.substack.com/)'s writing on
[self-reinvention](https://florenceyho.substack.com/p/a-flailing-attempt-at-self-reinvention)
in our early 20's. You should read her post (and [subscribe to her

# Discipline

I've been thinking a lot about discipline lately.

I'm now starting my 3rd year in the computer science PhD at Berkeley.
This program has continuously disciplined and regimented me.


I bring my whole self to the PhD. A bucket too narrow to fill.

The PhD feels like a bucket too small to squeeze my interests, my
passions, myself into. Dreams and passions are the overflow; ...

If you are a cool Viet person in EECS pls hmu :^)

Thus far, I have met three Southeast Asian folks in the CS grad program
here. There are [741](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/about/by-the-numbers/)
grad students in EECS. I've met one Vietnamese person in this program so
far, and it's _literally just fucking me_.

Nobody talks about Palestine.

I feel alone and isolated. I have no desire to engage with most of my
professional community.

I wake up and I'm punished. I imagine an Old Testament God testing my
devotion---to this job, to a higher power, to any sense of greater meaning.

At this point, I've been told by multiple mentor figures that centering
justice work in my research agenda is untenable, unreliable, and a
collection of many other "un-" words.

# Escape

Florence imagines herself trundling through barren and stifling Mesquite
deserts, or wrapping herself in Mexico City's cacophony of art and
culture and hustle and bustle. Florence yearns to be unknown, remade.
Florence dreams of reinvention, as do I.

I sit in lab and start daydreaming about
finding an ethnic studies advisor who loves me and my work, who not only
thinks exactly like I do, but can read my mind without me having to even
say anything, and thus I hop ship to a humanities PhD where I feel
affirmed and comfy in my work at all times. In another version, I uproot
my life and move to New York City, taking the subway at 4 am after
parties, organizing work, all that.

Of course, I know that materially, doing any of those things would be
dumb. Discussion of BIPOC folks in any capacity is under attack. And
that presumes I could get in to begin with; it is difficult for the best
and brightest young ethnic studies scholars to find academic positions
for themselves at this point, to say nothing of the likelihood that I, a
computer science PhD student, could do so for myself. 

I've spent my whole life chasing authenticity and my "true
passion," and there's such a gravitational allure to. Maybe it's because
I grew up a people pleaser and so my inner voice is so hard to hear. But
I've always envied people who can wear their hearts on their sleeve, who
can live truly according to themselves. CS more than ever feels like a
compromise between what I care about and what will pay my rent---

There is an irrestible allure to escape.

# Masochism

Much of my life is organized around my hobbies. As a child I learned to
play piano and practiced wushu.
<span class="aside">
An aside: join Cal Wushu!!
</span>
I've done both of
these activities long enough to be pretty good at them now. And in
each case, I fucking _hated_ the process of actually getting good.

I've always been a talk shit first, ask questions later kinda guy. I
hate walking the walk. I get bored of putting in the work. I hate all
that shit.

For all the endeavors in life I'm proficient at, I hated the process of
improving at.

Proficiency demands masochism. We sacrifice the ego, listen to critique
and ... We wake up day in and day out to run or stretch or play or
whatever it is. Dancers are always talking about "the push": they travel
thousands of miles to LA studios to learn absurdly difficult choreo for
"the push," they receive cutting critiques from dance directors and then
thank them for "the push."

I think there is something fundamentally masochistic about getting
better at things. You have to suspend your ego, submit yourself to ...

Escape is a toxic situationship.

from above sec:
But it sucks. Obviously material things suck. But also existential
things. There's no guarantee of more supportive spaces.

# Utopia

Fantasizing about the life that I would do has been a useful thought
exercise. But in other ways, it is a distraction!

Proficiency demands masochism; as my friend [Shm](https://shmuh.co/)
remarked recently, the PhD demands we mourn the parts of ourselves that
cannot do what we want to do.

It's valuable to be that person for other people! Not that inclusion is
the be-all end-all, but . yknow.

Of course, the most obvious reference point for the utopia in the present is
José Esteban Muñoz. If I had a nickel for every time I heard "utopia"
and "José Esteban Muñoz" mentioned together, I'd have, like, $3. Which
honestly?? Kind of a lot tbh.

But I also think about my conversations with my
friend
[Chris](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/graduate-student/christine-phan)
about Fred Moten and Stefano Harvey's writing on [the
undercommons](https://ou.edu/content/dam/Education/documents/the%20university%20and%20the%20undercommons.pdf);
the creative thinking and survival-making that minoritized folks do in
our every day lives; the work unsanctioned and made fugitive by the
university that fills our cup and makes possible our creative labors,
that makes the professional personal and the personal possible.

I am in a programming languages PhD, advised by a programming languages
advisor, here to do programming languages work. But the work of a PL PhD
isn't just writing PL papers and submitted to PL conferences. It is late
night chats with the besties complaining about bullshit happening in the
computer science department. It is emails to and conversations with
like-minded scholars in ethnic studies and information science and
rhetoric and literature and whatever disciplines my interests and
communities take me to. It is going to improv class for the first time
and taking dance classes and winning wushu competitions. These are not
auxiliary parts of my PhD---these are the life- and soul-sustaining
activities that give my PhD meaning, possibility, and imaginativity.

The work is making spaces that are safe for me and for people like me.
And it fucking sucks that I have to work and fight for those spaces. But
this is the work. It is the work that the university will exploit and
grind into perfectly polished diamonds - . It is
simultaneously,


I started this piece is a response to Florence, but really it's a
response to all the lovely conversations I've been having with the
constellation of folks in my life around difficult transitions, existing
under fascism, and wanting to give up. This is my love letter to all the
folks I've been co-commiserating with over the past few months, the
folks whose late night rants and quiet moments of parallel play have
sustained me and affirmed in me my capacity to insist upon myself, even
in adversarial spaces and conditions. We're in this together :^)
